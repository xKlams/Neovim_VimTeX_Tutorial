# TeX_Notes_Setup
A brief tutorial to setup Neovim Vimtex and other useful plugins to take notes faster.

# Warning
All these steps are performed in Fedora Workstation 39.
I have mainly taken inspiration from [this](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/) blog that i read a while back.

# Tutorial Start
First thing first we will need to install neovim.
fedora:

      sudo dnf update && sudo dnf install neovim

arch:

      sudo pacman -Sy install neovim

Also install neovim python module

    pip3 install --user neovim
